              My journey in front-end development merges my passion for
              technology with an eye for design.
            </h3>
            <p>
              With a background as a virtual business support executive, I was
              exposed to website builders, and both built and maintained sites
              for my clients. I started to get interested in code when I was
              researching features I wanted to add that weren't always standard,
              and required custom HTML/CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              The more I explored, the more I wanted to know. So, I took the
              leap and funded my own journey through a front-end development
              course. This experience sharpened my skills and made me even more
              passionate about making websites that donâ€™t just work well but
              look great too.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you'll find me delving into the latest tech
              innovations or enjoying a good book. My skills include HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript, and a knack for responsive design. I'm a lifelong
              learner, always adding new tools to my arsenal.
